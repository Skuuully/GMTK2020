# GMTK2020

This project was made as a submission for the GMTK gamejam 2020 which had the theme out of control.
The jam took course over 48 hours on a weekend, of which i spent a decent amount of time (still slept followed my sleeping habits etc.)

The code is rather sloppy and has many areas where it could be improved and in a fair few areas it is not very scalable. The code more gets the job done for the small scale of it.
I also couldnt find a similarity to javas super() method which limits my use of inheritance.
Wouldve much preferred to have had some base logic for the commands system for example.

During the project Ive had fun creating it however the resulting game isnt great and as a prototype it would tell me that the idea itself isnt worth pursuing any further
